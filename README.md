# ToDoList-v1
Introduction - 
A simple To Do List using EJS, Express JavaScript, CSS using Node. It is not connected with any database jsut a frontend look and some logics using express and used node as a server. 

Sort Description - 
A To Do List website built using EJS, Node.js, Express, and CSS is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. The website uses the EJS templating language to dynamically generate HTML pages on the server-side. The Node.js platform is used to create the server and handle the backend logic, while the Express framework provides a simple way to route HTTP requests and handle user inputs. The CSS is used to style the user interface and create an aesthetically pleasing design.

Embedded JavaScript (EJS) - 
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that allows you to embed JavaScript code into HTML. It's used to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side and is commonly used in Node.js-based web applications. EJS templates are plain HTML files with embedded JavaScript expressions, which are evaluated and replaced with actual values at runtime. This provides a clean separation between presentation and logic, making it easy to create dynamic, reusable templates.

For storing the data proviting it to the user on the go when user needed used MongoDB's framework mongoose - 

MongoDB - 

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is highly scalable, flexible and provides powerful querying and indexing capabilities. Here are some key features and concepts of MongoDB:

Collections: MongoDB stores documents in collections, which are similar to tables in a relational database.
Documents: A document is a set of key-value pairs, similar to a JSON object.
Indexing: MongoDB allows for the creation of indexes on fields within a collection, which can greatly improve query performance.
Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling of data across multiple machines.

Mongoose - 

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with MongoDB by allowing developers to define schemas for their data. Here are some key features and concepts of Mongoose:

Schemas: Mongoose allows developers to define schemas for their data, which can include fields, data types, and validation rules.
Models: Mongoose provides a way to define and interact with collections in MongoDB using models. Models allow developers to create, read, update, and delete documents in a collection.
Middleware: Mongoose supports middleware functions that can be run before or after certain operations, such as saving or removing a document.
Queries: Mongoose provides a powerful query API for interacting with MongoDB. It supports a wide variety of query types, including find, update, and delete operations.
In summary, MongoDB and Mongoose are powerful tools for storing and interacting with data in a NoSQL database. MongoDB provides the underlying database system, while Mongoose provides a simple and intuitive way to define schemas and interact with MongoDB using Node.js.
